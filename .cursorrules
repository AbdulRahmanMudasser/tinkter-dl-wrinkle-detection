# Comic Catalog Manager - Development Standards

## Git Commit Message Standards

### Commit Message Format
All commit messages MUST follow the Conventional Commit specification:
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Type must be one of: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, test, ci, build, perf, revert
- Subject must be lowercase
- Subject should be concise and descriptive
- Keep first line under 72 characters

### Examples
- feat(auth): add user login functionality
- fix(api): resolve token refresh issue
- chore: update dependencies
- docs(readme): add deployment instructions

### Branch Naming
- Format: `<type>/<descriptive-name>`
- Use lowercase and hyphens
- Example: feat/add-user-authentication or fix/resolve-api-timeout

### Pull Request Format
- Title: Follow Conventional Commit format (lowercase)
- Description should include:
  ### description
  explain what you changed and why

  ### changes
  - list main changes

  ### checklist
  - [ ] tested locally
  - [ ] documentation updated

### Key Rules
- NEVER use capital letters in commit messages
- NEVER use capital letters in branch names  
- ALWAYS start with a valid type prefix
- ALWAYS use conventional commit format
- ALWAYS keep messages concise and lowercase

### File Verification Before Commits
- ALWAYS verify file paths exist before creating commit commands
- Use `Test-Path` (PowerShell) or `ls` (bash) to verify files exist
- NEVER include non-existent files in git add commands
- When user requests commits, verify ALL file paths first using:
  - `git status` to see actual modified/untracked files
  - `Test-Path <file-path>` to verify each file exists
- Only propose commits with verified file paths
- If file doesn't exist, either skip it or inform the user

### Documentation File Naming Standards
- Global/project README file: MUST be named "README.md" (capital letters, no hyphens) and placed in the project root
- All other documentation files created by cursor (guides, plans, user guides, implementation summaries, etc.):
  - MUST be placed in a folder named "helping-documentations" (all lowercase with hyphens)
  - MUST use all lowercase filenames
  - MUST use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_)
  - Examples: "helping-documentations/project-summary.md", "helping-documentations/user-guide.md", "helping-documentations/implementation-plan.md", "helping-documentations/api-documentation.md"
- NEVER use "README.md" for cursor-generated documentation files (except the main project README)
- NEVER use underscores in filenames, always use hyphens

## Responsive Design - All Screens
- ALWAYS design mobile-first: start with smallest screen (320px+), then enhance for larger screens
- Test on all breakpoints: mobile (320px-639px), tablet (640px-1023px), desktop (1024px+)
- Use Tailwind responsive prefixes: `sm:` (640px), `md:` (768px), `lg:` (1024px), `xl:` (1280px), `2xl:` (1536px)
- Typography: `text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg` for responsive text sizing
- Grid layouts: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for responsive columns
- Spacing: adjust padding/margin per breakpoint `p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8`
- Images: always use `w-full h-auto` to maintain aspect ratio across screens
- Navigation: mobile hamburger menu that converts to horizontal nav on desktop
- Tables: make scrollable on mobile or convert to cards `overflow-x-auto`
- Hide/show elements: `hidden md:block` to show on medium+ screens only
- Touch targets: minimum 44x44px on mobile devices
- Forms: stack inputs vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- Buttons: full-width on mobile, auto-width on desktop `w-full md:w-auto`
- Sidebars: collapse on mobile with overlay, fixed on desktop
- Cards: single column on mobile, multi-column grid on larger screens
- Modals/dialogs: full-screen on mobile, centered modal on desktop
- Icons: appropriate size for each screen (smaller on mobile, larger on desktop)

## Security Best Practices
- NEVER commit API keys, secrets, tokens, or credentials to git
- Use environment variables (.env) for all sensitive configuration
- Add .env files to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
- Validate and sanitize ALL user inputs before processing
- Use HTTPS for all API calls and external resources
- Implement proper authentication checks in protected routes
- Protect against XSS attacks by sanitizing user-generated content
- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements (never raw SQL or string concatenation)
- Keep all dependencies updated with latest security patches
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers when possible
- Hash passwords using bcrypt or similar (never store plain text)
- Implement CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Set secure, HttpOnly cookies for session management
- Limit request body size to prevent DoS attacks
- Log security events but never log sensitive data
- Use environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- Restrict CORS origins to trusted domains only
- Implement input length limits to prevent buffer overflow
- Escape special characters in user-generated content

### Documentation File Naming Standards
- Global/project README file: MUST be named "README.md" (capital letters, no hyphens)
- All other documentation files created by cursor (guides, plans, user guides, implementation summaries, etc.):
  - MUST use all lowercase filenames
  - MUST use hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_)
  - Examples: "project-summary.md", "user-guide.md", "implementation-plan.md", "api-documentation.md"
- NEVER use "README.md" for cursor-generated documentation files (except the main project README)
- NEVER use underscores in filenames, always use hyphens
